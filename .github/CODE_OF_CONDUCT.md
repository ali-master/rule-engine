# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The **@usex/rule-engine** project is committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive community. As contributors and maintainers of this JSON-based rule engine, we pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We believe that a diverse community of developers, architects, and business analysts makes our rule engine better and more valuable for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Inclusive Communication**: Using welcoming and inclusive language in issues, pull requests, and discussions
- **Respectful Collaboration**: Being respectful of differing technical approaches, architectural decisions, and implementation strategies
- **Constructive Feedback**: Gracefully accepting and providing constructive criticism on code, documentation, and rule engine design
- **Community Focus**: Prioritizing what benefits the broader rule engine community and user ecosystem
- **Empathy and Support**: Showing empathy towards other community members, especially when helping newcomers understand rule engine concepts
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Actively sharing knowledge about business rules, JSON schemas, and engine optimization
- **Technical Excellence**: Striving for high-quality code, comprehensive documentation, and robust testing

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- **Harassment and Discrimination**: The use of sexualized language or imagery, trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- **Privacy Violations**: Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- **Technical Gatekeeping**: Deliberately making newcomers feel unwelcome or inferior based on their technical knowledge or experience level
- **Destructive Criticism**: Providing criticism that is not constructive or that attacks the person rather than the idea or implementation
- **Spam and Self-Promotion**: Excessive self-promotion, spam, or off-topic discussions unrelated to rule engines or the project
- **Bad Faith Participation**: Contributing with malicious intent, deliberately introducing bugs, or sabotaging the project
- **Violation of Licensing**: Misusing the project's MIT license or violating intellectual property rights
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional open-source environment

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The maintainers of @usex/rule-engine have the right and responsibility to:

- **Moderate Content**: Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, documentation, wiki edits, issues, pull requests, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct

- **Community Management**: Foster an inclusive environment where both technical experts and newcomers can contribute meaningfully to the rule engine ecosystem
- **Enforcement Actions**: Take temporary or permanent action against contributors for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful to the community
- **Technical Leadership**: Guide the architectural direction of the rule engine while remaining open to community input and innovative ideas
